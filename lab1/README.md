This is a simple python script to copy a file bytewise into
a newly created file inside the directory "recv" directly under
the directory in which the script is ran.  To run the program, switch
to the directory it is in and type in a command line:

    python3 copy.py <filename>

where <filename> is the relative path to the file you wish to copy
